# OMNI App
## Purpose
Become more comfortable with iOS and development tools. 

The reason I built this app was for three things:
1) A consolidated app to control IoT Smart Home Things (like lights and door switches)
2) Tell me the status of my bing rewards spammer, and give me a alert when my bing status spammer is done 
3) Let me add stocks/monitor stocks potentially to buy/sell in my portofolio 

## Future Modifications
Add support for smart home opener

## WireFrame
Final Product will look more polished
